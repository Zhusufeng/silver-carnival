This is a full stack [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app with a custom Node TypeScript server within one repo. It is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). You cannot deploy on Vercel because Vercel does not support servers.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can see the frontend by going to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

To see that you can make a request to the server, you can make a GET request [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello).
